Project was imported and originally made for CS 3345 (Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis) with Professor Kamran Khan.

Thoughts: Nothing particularly difficult or complex about this project. AVL tree rotation for imbalances might've been difficult to figure out but that was the only thing
given as part of the sample code. Tree validation boils down to double-checking heights or parent-child relationships and a lot of if-else statements.
